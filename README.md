## ⚙️ Engineering Approach

I enjoy the building process — especially when things break.

What drives me:
- Solving real implementation problems
- Handling edge cases deliberately
- Making systems reliable under concurrency
- Shipping working, end-to-end applications

I focus on writing backend logic that is predictable, structured, and production-minded.
